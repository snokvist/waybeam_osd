3. **No Commercial Use.** Commercial use of any kind—including but not limited to providing services, products, or solutions that incorporate the Software, or using the Software to operate a service for others—is prohibited unless you first obtain written approval from the copyright holder.
4. **Derivative Works.** You may create modifications for your personal use, but you may not share, publish, or distribute those modifications without prior written approval. Derivative works remain subject to this license.

## Relationship to standard licenses

This agreement is **not** equivalent to MIT, BSD, Apache, GPL, or any other OSI-approved license because those licenses allow redistribution and commercial reuse. It is also narrower than noncommercial templates such as the PolyForm Noncommercial License, which still permit certain sharing without explicit approval. The bespoke Autod Personal Use License is therefore required to enforce the owner's "no redistribution without written consent" policy.

## Third-party components

The `firmware/` directory contains the OpenIPC firmware build system, which is
licensed under the MIT License (Copyright (c) 2021 OpenIPC). See
`firmware/LICENSE` for the full MIT license text. Third-party packages within
the firmware tree retain their original licenses (LVGL: MIT, cJSON: MIT,
comgt: GPL-2.0, etc.).

This Autod Personal Use License applies to the application-level code created
by Joakim Snökvist (main.c, osd_send.c, config.json, and related files).
The firmware tree's MIT license is preserved and respected.
